## angular-data

__Data store for Angular.js.__

__Current version:__ 0.8.0

Angular-data is in a pre-1.0.0 development stage; the API is fluctuating, not a lot of tests yet, etc.

Not for production use (yet). If you still want to develop with Angular-data, be prepared to keep a close eye on the changelog, as the API is very liable to change (a lot).

Pending:
- A Solid Roadmap
- Relations/Associations
- Various Adapters
- Schema Definition/Validation
- Cache Expiry
- Nested Resources
- Website / documentation
- 100% tested (whatever _that_ means)
- See [issues](https://github.com/jmdobry/angular-data/issues?milestone=7&page=1&state=open) for what's in development
- See [Design Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o069KLuBH4jpwm1FCLZFwKMgM73Xi8_1JyjhSxVpidM/edit?usp=sharing) for other juicy reading material
